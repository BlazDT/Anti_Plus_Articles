# Anti_Plus_Articles
This filter hides paywall articles. I got sick of scrolling a site and seeing so many paywall articles which cannot be read for free.<br>
Feel free to open an issue with the site name.<br>
Required are full URLs where links to paywall articles can be seen.<br>
Please note rules will only be removed if they break something for a free user. Users who pay for a site can use filter protocol to whitelist.<br>
