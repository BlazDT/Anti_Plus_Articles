# Anti_Plus_Articles
This filter hides paywall articles. I got sick of scrolling a site and seeing so many paywall articles which cannot be read for free.<br>
Feel free to open an issue with the site name.<br>
<br>
Required are:<br>
<br>
  a) full URLs where links to paywall articles can be seen.<br>
  b) your operating system (Windows/Mac/Android/iOS) and browser (Chrome/FireFox/Safari)<br>
  c) screenshots are required if the site's language is not English or German. Please highlight the paywall articles in your screenshots, thank you. For English and German I may request them<br>
<br>
It can take a while until I will address issues, so please be patient<br>
Please note rules will only be removed if they break something for a free user. Users who pay for a site can use filter protocol to whitelist.<br>
