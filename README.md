# Anti_Plus_Articles
This filter hides paywall articles. I got sick of scrolling a site and seeing so many paywall articles which cannot be read for free.<br>
Feel free to open an issue with the site name.
Required are full URLs where plus articles can be seen.
Please note rules will only be removed if they break something for a free user. Users who pay for a site can use filter protocol to whitelist.
